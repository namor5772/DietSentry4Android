On the Eaten Table screen, with the Daily totals checkbox checked I would
  like to enhance what data is displayed in the scrollable table viewer.
  Currently it displays data from the Eaten table aggragated/summed by Date.
  What I would like to do is to add a field called "My weight (kg)" under the
  "Daily Totals" text which is the Weight entry from the Weight table for that
  date (ie. where DateWeight is the same as DateEaten). If there is no such
  date in the Weight table then display: "My weight (kg)     NA"

The app can export the "internal" foods.db file to an "external" directory in
  the phone. I would like to create a button called [Export Eaten daily] in the
  Utilities screen which when pressed would save a csv file called
  EatenDailyAll.csv to the same directory by default.

    csv format of  what is displayed in the EatenTable screen's scrollable table
    viewer when the All option is selected, the Daily total checkbox is ticked
    and the Filter by date checkbox is unchecked). Make sure the file has
    headings but do not include the "Daily totals" text/field in any way.
