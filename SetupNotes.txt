# **Add Recipe**
This is the screen where a recipe food can be created.

By its very nature a recipe food is more complicated that a liquid or solid food and hence this screen is more complex.

***
# **What is a recipe food?**
A recipe food is a food record in the Foods table AND and a collection of ingredient records in the Recipe table.

For the purpose of logging consumption you select it (from the scrollable table viewer in the Foods Table screen) just like the simpler solid and liquid foods and it is considered a solid in that its amount consumed is measured in grams. Differences in processing are only apparent when you Edit, Add or Copy it. 

You can identify a recipe food by noting that its FoodDescription field ends in text of the form " {recipe=[weight]g}" or " {recipe=[weight]g} *" where [weight] is the total amount in grams of the ingredient foods (all assumed to be solids).

The ingredients making up the recipe food are stored in the Recipe table, with each ingredient record linked to the record in the Foods table by its FoodId.
The **Recipe table structure** is as follows:
```
Field name              Type    Units

RecipeId                INTEGER
FoodId                  INTEGER

```

The **RecipeId** field is never explicitly displayed or considered. It is a Primary Key that is auto incremented when a record is created.

The **FoodId** field is the Primary Key of this recipe foods record in the Foods table. This is what identifies the particular ingredient records from the Recipe table with the food record in the Foods table.

The **CopyFg** field can only be 0 (default) or 1. It is used internally when a recipe food is being Edited, Added or Copied.
 
The **FoodDescription** is the same field as for the ingredients record from the Foods table.

The remaining (**Energy** and **Nutrient fields**) are the same as for the corresponding Foods table record (the ingredient), except that they are scaled by the amount of the food used in the recipe. Eg. if Amount=250 then all these field values are multiplied by 2.5. This is analogous to what happens to records in the Eaten table.    
   
Once all the ingredients of a recipe are known, the end markers of the recipes FoodDescription field in the Foods table record are set to " {recipe=[weight]g}" or " {recipe=[weight]g} *" where [weight] is the total amount in grams of all the ingredient foods. Furthermore the Energy and Nutrient fields (of this Foods table record) are scaled by 100/[weight]. This guarantees that when you LOG this recipe food using [weight] as the amount consumed you will get the correct Energy and Nutrient values (as if you had consumed the meal represented by the recipe)..
