ou did a good job, but I would like some changes to the way the data is displayed in the more detailed option. Remove the text line "Nutritional Information:" , leaving the same spacing between the Amount row and the nutritional information rows below it. use the same font for the nutritional information rows as as for the amount row.

Text("Nutritional Information:", fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold)

I want to wire up the Edit button from the page titled "Foods Table", When the EDIT
  button is pressed I would like a dialog to appear that displays all the current
  fields (with labels to the left) of the selected record from the Foods table, except
  for the FoodId field. I need to be able to edit any of the values of these fields by
  typing in changes. At the bottom of this dailog there should be a

I want to change the behaviour of this app when the Edit button is pressed on the
  Foods Table screen. 1. If the food being edited is a solid type (identified by NOT
  having " mL" or " mL#" at the end of its description string) then the heading of the
  Edit Food Screen that appears should be changed to "Edit Solid Food", In addition
  record/store whether the Description string ends in " mL", " mL#", " #" or ANYTHING
  ELSE. Then strip " mL", " mL#" or " #", from the description if this is how it ends
  before displaying it in the edit box. When the Edit button is pressed, update the
  Foods record with the edit box fields as before but first append the recorded food
  description ends (if any) back onto the food description string. 2. if the food being
  edited
  
   a solid type (identified by NOT
  having " mL" or " mL#" at the end of its description string) then the heading of the
  Edit Food Screen that appears should be changed to "Edit Solid Food", In addition
  record/store whether the Description string ends in " mL", " mL#", " #" or ANYTHING
  ELSE. Then strip " mL", " mL#" or " #", from the description if this is how it ends
  before displaying it in the edit box. When the Edit button is pressed, update the
  Foods record with the edit box fields as before but first append the recorded food
  description ends (if any) back onto the food description string.

  Could you provide very detailed descriptions of the the supported markdown features,
  including actual examles




• Here’s what the renderer supports, with examples and notes on how it shows up:

  - Headings & separators
      - # Title, ## Section, ### Subsection; levels >3 render as bold body text.
      - Horizontal rules: --- (or ***) draws a divider.
  - Paragraphs & breaks
      - Normal paragraphs flow as body text.
      - Hard break: line 1  \nline 2 (two trailing spaces or backslash) forces a new
        line inside a paragraph.
      - Soft breaks keep words on the next line when text wraps.
  - Inline styling
      - Bold: **important**
      - Italic: *emphasis*
      - Strikethrough: ~~deprecated~~
      - Inline code: `val x = 1` with monospace + shaded background.
  - Links / autolinks
      - [Open site](https://example.com) renders underlined in the primary color and
        opens via UriHandler.
      - https://example.com or www.example.com autolink to the URL.
      - Blank destinations are ignored (no crash).
  - Lists
      - Bullets (nesting supported):

        - Item A
          - Nested A1
      - Ordered lists with start numbers:

        3. Third
        4. Fourth
      - Task lists (shows disabled checkboxes when the task-list extension is present):

        - [ ] To do
        - [x] Done
        If the extension isn’t available, they fall back to bullets.
  - Blockquotes
      - > Quoted text shows with a vertical accent bar and indented content; nested
        quotes indent further.
  - Code blocks
      - Fenced:

        ```kotlin
        fun main() = println("hi")

      - Indented code blocks also work.
      - Rendered with monospace font on a rounded, shaded surface; preserves spacing.
  - Tables (GFM)
      - Alignment respected; horizontally scrolls if wide:

        | Food  | Qty | Energy |
        |:------|:---:|------:|
        | Apple | 1   |   52  |
        | Bread | 2   |  200  |
      - Header row bold; cells render inline markdown.
  - Images
      - ![Alt text](https://example.com/img.png "Title") shows fallback text (title/
        alt/url); images are not loaded.

# **Foods Table**
This is the main screen of the app.

Its purpose is to display a list of foods from the Foods table and allow interaction with a selected food.
***
## Explanation of GUI elements
The GUI elements on the screen are (starting at the top left hand corner and working across and down):   
- The **heading** of the screen is "Foods Table". 
- A **segmented button** with three options (Min, NIP, All). The selection is persistent between app restarts. 
  - **Min**: only displays the text description for food items.
  - **NIP**: in addition displays the minimum mandated nutrient information (per 100g or 100mL of the food) as required in Australia on their Nutritional Information Panels (NIP)
  - **All**: Displays all nutrient fields stored in the Foods table (23 which includes Energy)
- The **help button** `?` which displays this help screen.
- The **navigation button** `->` which transfers you to the Eaten Table screen.
- A **text field** which when empty displays the text "Enter food filter text"
  - Type any text in the field and press the Enter key or equivalent. This filters the list of foods to those that contain this text anywhere in their description.
  - It is NOT case sensitive
- A **scrollable table viewer** which actually displays records from the Foods table.
  - When a particular food is selected (by tapping it) a selection panel appears at the bottom of the screen. It displays the description of the selected food followed by four buttons below it:
    - **Eaten**: which logs the selected food into the Eaten Table.
        - It opens a dialog box where you can specify the amount eaten as well as the date and time this has occurred (with the default being now).
        - Press the **Confirm** button when you are ready to log your food. This transfers focus to the Eaten Table screen where the just logged food will be visible.
        - You can abort this process by tapping anywhere outside the dialog box. This closes it.
    - **Edit**: which allows you to edit the selected food.
        - It opens a screen titled "Editing Solid Food" or "Editing Liquid Food", obviously depending on the type of food you have selected. 
    - **Insert**: which allows you to add a new food record to the Foods table.
        - It opens a screen titled "insert Food".
        - The original selected food has no relevance to this activity. It is just a way for making the Insert button available.   
    - **Delete**: which removes the selected food from the Foods table.
        - It opens a dialog which warns you that you will be deleting the selected food from the Foods table.
        - This is irrevocable if you press the **Delete** button.
        - You can change you mind about doing this by just tapping anywhere outside the dialog box. This closes it.
***
## Foods table structure
GFM table rules (so the app renders a table instead of stray characters):
- Leave a blank line before the table.
- Start and end each line with `|` and separate cells with `|`.
- The separator row uses dashes (add `:` for alignment).
- Do not indent the table with spaces or tabs.
***

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
|:----------|:---------:|----------:|
| apple   | 2.54   | left    |
| pear      | 2.70      | right     |
| bananas   | 0.75      | **right** |







    


The markdown renderer`that is used in this app i am pretty sure supports the following features, confirm this:

  - Headings & separators
      - # Title, ## Section, ### Subsection; levels >3 render as bold body text.
      - Horizontal rules: --- (or ***) draws a divider.
  - Paragraphs & breaks
      - Normal paragraphs flow as body text.
      - Hard break: line 1  \nline 2 (two trailing spaces or backslash) forces a new
        line inside a paragraph.
      - Soft breaks keep words on the next line when text wraps.
  - Inline styling
      - Bold: **important**

      - Strikethrough: ~~deprecated~~
      - Inline code: `val x = 1` with monospace + shaded background.
  - Lists
      - Bullets (nesting supported):

        - Item A
          - Nested A1
      - Ordered lists with start numbers:

        3. Third
        4. Fourth
  - Blockquotes
      - > Quoted text shows with a vertical accent bar and indented content; nested
        quotes indent further.
  - Code blocks
      - Fenced:

        ```kotlin
        fun main() = println("hi")

      - Indented code blocks also work.
      - Rendered with monospace font on a rounded, shaded surface; preserves spacing.

To simplify the code remove any other rendering features that you already have if that is possible.
